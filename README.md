## CHALLENGE: Build a Space Biology Superhero :bug:

### The Challenge
Space exploration involves overcoming numerous challenges: extreme gravity, disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms, limited supplies, and access to medical care, etc. Your challenge is to design a platform that allows users to explore space travel stresses, understand how diverse organisms deal with these stresses, and then build a “Space Biology Superhero” by combining features from these organisms.
### Background

On Earth we are already superheroes with astounding abilities. Overcoming the gravity of a 5,973,600,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg planet? No problem! Synchronizing our metabolism to the comings and goings of a G-type main-sequence star (a.k.a. the Sun)? Done! Breathing in the waste gases of algae and plants? You’re doing it right now!

But what happens when we leave our home planet for new destinations in the solar system? Do we become even more powerful? In some ways, yes; Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard hit a golf ball 2.5 miles across the lunar surface! But in other ways, no; decades of research have shown that bone and muscle mass decline in space and that the space radiation environment presents risks to long-term human health.

There are many risks associated with long-distance human space exploration and human habitation outside Earth. They include experiencing microgravity in flight, hypergravity during launch and landing, disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms, limited supplies, restricted access to medical care, exposure to the microbes found on spacecraft, and many more.

Luckily, a wealth of data has been collected on how other organisms respond to spaceflight environments. Plants, microbes, flies, and worms have all flown in space to provide data that allows us to understand how they adapt to this unique environment.

In addition, many model organisms have been used to understand how spaceflight impacts biology and the ramifications for solar system exploration. Rodents are used to model mammalian physiology. Fruit flies and nematodes are good models for processes occurring in complex organisms. Plant models are studied with an eye on future in-space crop production systems. In addition, microbes are studied not only because of the potential harms they pose, but also for their potential as biomanufacturing chassis.

### Objectives
Your challenge is to design a platform (digital or analog) that allows users to explore the environmental stresses of space travel, understand how diverse organisms deal with these stresses, and then build a “Space Biology Superhero” by combining features from these organisms. The main goal is to inform users about the challenges of spaceflight and how scientists are performing biological experimentation in space, and to excite users about space exploration and the biological research that will enable future missions.

### Potential Considerations
As you develop your platform, you may (but are not required to) consider the following:

Your platform can be digital or analog. Potential formats could be a board game, card game, website, computer game, or any other format that meets the objectives above.
To find additional resources, you could conduct an internet search to gather relevant information that may be useful. Potential search keywords could include:
Fundamental biological features of spaceflight
Advancing the field to enable deep-space exploration
